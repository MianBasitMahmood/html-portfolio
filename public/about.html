<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a Communications Officer at Special Communications Organization (SCO) for over three years, I applied my skills in computer software engineering, 
  project management, and stakeholder engagement to support the development and implementation of various 
  communication systems and solutions for the defense sector. I contributed to the design, testing, and deployment of multiple 
  software applications, platforms, and networks, ensuring their quality, security, and reliability.</p>

<p>I also facilitated the communication and coordination among internal and external stakeholders,
   including clients, vendors, partners, and end-users, to deliver timely and satisfactory outcomes. 
   I recently graduated with a master's degree in Quality Systems Engineering at Concordia University, 
   where I expanded my knowledge and competencies in quality management, process improvement, and system optimization.</p>

<p>My goal is to leverage my education and experience to pursue a career in the field of quality engineering, 
  where I can apply my passion for delivering high-quality products and services that meet the needs 
  and expectations of diverse and demanding customers.</p>
